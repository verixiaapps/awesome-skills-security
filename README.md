"Show me common passwords from the security-passwords skill"

"Help me detect exposed API keys using the security-patterns skill"

"I need XSS payloads from the security-payloads skill"
```

### Practical Usage Examples

**Example 1: SQL Injection Testing**
```
"I need to test a login form for SQL injection. Use the security-fuzzing skill to show me relevant payloads"
```

**Example 2: Password Auditing**
```
"Use the security-passwords skill to show me the most common weak passwords to test against our password policy"
```

**Example 3: Code Review for Secrets**
```
"Use the security-patterns skill to help me scan this codebase for exposed API keys and credentials"
```

**Example 4: CTF Challenge**
```
"I'm working on a web exploitation CTF challenge. Use the security-payloads skill to help me approach this"
```

**Example 5: LLM Security Testing**
```bash
# Test for AI model biases
"Use the llm-testing skill to help me test this AI model for gender bias"

# Comprehensive AI safety audit
"I need to perform a red team assessment on this LLM. Use the llm-testing skill to show me prompts for bias detection, alignment testing, and adversarial resistance"
```

### Direct File Access

If you cloned the repository, access wordlists directly:

```python
# Example: Load SQL injection payloads
with open('skills/security-fuzzing/references/Fuzzing/quick-SQLi.txt', 'r') as f:
    sqli_payloads = f.read().splitlines()

# Example: Load common passwords
with open('skills/security-passwords/references/500-worst-passwords.txt', 'r') as f:
    passwords = f.read().splitlines()

# Example: Use in security testing
for payload in sqli_payloads[:10]:
    test_injection(target_url, payload)
```

### Example Workflows

**SQL Injection Testing (Authorized)**
```
1. Ask your agent to use the security-fuzzing skill

## Best Practices

### When Using Password Lists
- Only test against systems you own or have written authorization to test
- Implement rate limiting to avoid account lockouts
- Monitor for defensive responses (WAF blocks, account locks)
- Use appropriate delays between attempts

### When Using Fuzzing Payloads
- Test in isolated environments first
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Check for secondary effects (logs, monitoring alerts)
- Document all findings systematically

### When Using Web Shells
- Only use for detection system validation
- Test in isolated lab environments
- Never deploy on production systems
- Focus on defensive detection capabilities

## How to Use This on skills.sh

This repository is published on the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) open agent skills directory — the public registry for the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) ecosystem. Skills are discovered from the `skills/` directory and appear on the [skills.sh leaderboard](https://skills.sh/) as users install them.

**Collection page:** [skills.sh/Eyadkelleh/awesome-skills-security](https://skills.sh/Eyadkelleh/awesome-skills-security)

### What is skills.sh?

[skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) is the directory and CLI for reusable agent skills. A single install command works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and dozens of other agents. No separate packaging or publish step is required — push valid `SKILL.md` files to a public GitHub repo and users can install immediately.

### For Users

```bash
# Browse what's available
npx skills add Eyadkelleh/awesome-skills-security --list

# Install all skills (project scope)
npx skills add Eyadkelleh/awesome-skills-security --skill '*' -y

# Install one skill to Cursor
npx skills add Eyadkelleh/awesome-skills-security --skill security-fuzzing -a cursor -y

# Search the skills.sh directory
npx skills find security
```

After installing, ask your agent to use a skill naturally:

```
"Use the security-fuzzing skill to show me SQL injection payloads"
```
